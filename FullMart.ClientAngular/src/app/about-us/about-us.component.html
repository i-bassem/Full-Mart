          <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4"> Want a superweapon to ignite your customer’s interest in a product? It’s right under your nose: Take your product’s unique features and turn them into benefits.

            What are features and benefits? Think about what gets you excited about your product that makes it different from your competitors’ products. It might be careful construction, ethically sourced materials, or all the bells and whistles you dreamed up over drinks one night. Those are features.
            
            Now, think about what those things do for your customer. Does careful construction mean that your product is safe for children? Do ethically sourced materials make the buyer feel good about purchasing your product? Do those bells and whistles make everyone who sees your customer with your product weep with envy? Those are benefits.
            
            In product descriptions, it’s easy to fall into the trap of only describing the features of your products. But when you just list the features, you’re not actually helping your buyer understand how your product will help them.
            
            Let’s talk about a product page that communicates both features and benefits effectively.
